    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item{Determined a purpose, vision, and roadmap to overhaul the internal software tools for the Dynamics group, and implemented the tools while continuously soliciting feedback and building in new features.}
        \item {Doubled the reliability and halved the time of test specification creation by designing and implementing a data analysis and data visualization software package.}
        \item {Decreased review time of technical documents by deploying a web application that Tallowed engineering to create a sharable and easily accessible and followable document.}
        \item {Ensured all vibration susceptible components were safe for Flight 21(the first rocket to land successfully) by writing Python scripts that queried thousands of vibration tests and checked against new testing standards.}
        \item {Mitigated component susceptibility to high frequency dynamics by working with designers, predicting vibration and shock environments through data aggregation of test and flight data, and implementing vibration tests to qualify hardware before flight.}
      \end{cvitems}
